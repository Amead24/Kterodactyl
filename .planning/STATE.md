## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (14 decisions from v1.0, all marked good).

v1.1 decisions:
- Playwright in top-level `e2e/` directory (not inside `web/`)
- Kind with NodePort + extraPortMappings over kubectl port-forward
- Chromium-only, workers: 1 in CI
- Fix envtest cached-client pattern before writing new tests
- Unified CI pipeline replacing separate workflow files

### Pending Todos

- **TODO-02** (Testing): Create a Playwright script for CI/CD integration testing of features

### Blockers/Concerns

None active.

**Tech debt from v1.0 (non-blocking):**
- DNS requires human testing with live Gateway API controller and ExternalDNS
- Relative path `"games/"` in cmd/main.go relies on container WORKDIR
- handleUploadMod and handleRestoreBackup bypass IsValidTransition guard
- Duplicate s3CredentialsSecretName constant in controller and API handler
